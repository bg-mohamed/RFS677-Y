### Hi there ðŸ‘‹, I'm m0ham3d
#### Geologist / Petroleum engineer / Data Enthusiast
A reconversed Petroleum engineer, I've never coded before 04/2021. The last time I coded some lines was with TurboPascal ðŸ‘´ (I know I'm old) when I was in my final high school year 2002 and with C & Matlab when I was on the preparatory classes for Engineering school 2003
I've started this github in order to host and shares my academic mini-projects related to my master degree.

Skills: Python / Machine Learning / Deep Learning / Data Science / Data Engineering..

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on this page. 
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Master Degree in Paris University1 PanthÃ©on Sorbonne 
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about Geology, Drilling, Data Science :D

My very first project was a kind of familiarization with Python coding and was a PWVAP calculation of 10 bitcoins exchanges

The second project is related to Data management, Data processing & cleaning, Data viz, and an optional section of prediction using Logistic regression

Then came statistics project at the end of Statistics-1 module, and the project include a statistical descriptive analysis + CAPM/Fama&French 3 and 5 factors application on 10 stocks exchanges from DowJones

 The Text mining project was also a cool one, the topic was Tweets scraping with keywords: "European super League", Text processing, Data viz and Text classification using unsupervised algorithms. I used K-Means, Topic Modeling Latent Dirichlet Allocation & NMF
